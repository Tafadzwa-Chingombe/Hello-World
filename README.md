# Hello-World
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow

Hi everyone. So this is my first time using Git Hub, and I'd like to learn as much as possible.
My journey with programming started off with me being a WordPress Developer.
I now have 3 years working with WordPress.
I then enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering Honors Degree at Zimbabwe Open University.
